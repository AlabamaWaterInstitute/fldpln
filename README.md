# FLDPLN
The FLDPLN concept was documented by [Jude Kastens' 2008 Ph.D. dissertation](https://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/handle/1808/5354) and was, in that document, put forward as 
> "... a new, physically-based computational model (called FLDPLN, or "Floodplain") for mapping potential inundation extents (floodplains) using gridded topographic data" 

And further,
> "Due to the parametric economy of FLDPLN, this model has significant advantages over existing methods such as hydrodynamic models."

Since that publication, FLDPLN has been used in a number of instances to estimate the inundated extents of floods in Kansas and elsewhere for both research and real-time emergency management purposes.
